The game can be played with several configurations regarding the grid size and the number of move per turn, that impact a lot the strategies.

The AI uses a combination of :
- programmed strategic algorithms for obvious moves and more elaborated "long-term" strategies
- a statistic algorithm using a data base of all previous games so that the AI adapts itself to the play style of a regular player

That makes the AI a very strong opponent for any player without experience with the game.
